## What's This About?

I was tired of:

-   Forgetting when my credit card payments were due
-   Not knowing how much I was spending on what
-   Having no clue about my overall financial health

So I built this to solve those problems! It's basically a personal finance dashboard that keeps everything organized.

## Features

-   **Credit Card Management**: Add all your credit cards in one place, track balances, limits, and due dates.
-   **Spending Tracking**: Log your expenses and categorize them to see where your money is actually going.
-   **Financial Health**: Visual charts showing your progress, including credit utilization and spending by category.
-   **API Documentation**: Interactive API documentation powered by Swagger.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (with Chart.js)
-   **Backend**: Node.js with Express
-   **Database**: SQLite
-   **Testing**: Jest & Supertest
-   **Linting**: ESLint & Prettier
