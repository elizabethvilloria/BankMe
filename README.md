# BankMe üí≥

A simple web app to help you keep track of your credit cards and get your finances in order. No more forgetting due dates or wondering where your money went!

## What's This About?

I was tired of:

- Forgetting when my credit card payments were due
- Not knowing how much I was spending on what
- Having no clue about my overall financial health

So I built this to solve those problems! It's basically a personal finance dashboard that keeps everything organized.

## What It Does

### Credit Card Management

- Add all your credit cards in one place
- Track balances, limits, and due dates
- See your credit utilization at a glance
- Never miss a payment again

### Spending Tracking

- Log your expenses and categorize them
- See where your money is actually going
- Set budgets and stick to them
- Get insights into your spending habits

### Financial Health

- Visual charts showing your progress
- Debt payoff strategies
- Monthly spending reports
- Financial goals tracking

## Tech Stuff

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite (because it's easy and works everywhere)
- **Charts**: Chart.js for pretty graphs
